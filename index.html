                    Today, the world faces many environmental, economic, and social problems that affect people's lives and hinder sustainable development. Among these issues, cities play a major role in facing many challenges, such as traffic congestion, air and water pollution, waste accumulation, energy and natural resource shortages.

                    Hence, the idea of sustainable cities came as a comprehensive solution to overcome these problems, aiming to create safe, healthy, and sustainable human communities environmentally, socially, and economically. This promotes human life in line with the sustainability of natural resources.

                   Thus, sustainable cities are based on sustainability principles and adopt a comprehensive approach that includes economic, social, and environmental aspects. The three factors are considered in a single framework, and decisions are made according to this comprehensive concept.

              <p class="card-text text-start">Electric public transportation refers to a system of mass transit that uses electric-powered vehicles to transport passengers. This can include electric buses, trains, and trams, among others.

                Electric public transportation is becoming increasingly popular as cities around the world seek to reduce their carbon footprint and promote sustainability. Electric vehicles produce zero emissions at the tailpipe, which makes them an attractive option for environmentally-conscious cities.

              <p class="card-text text-start">Waste management refers to the collection, transportation, processing, and disposal of waste materials. Proper waste management is important to minimize negative impacts on the environment and public health. The goal of waste management is to reduce the amount of waste produced, recover materials that can be recycled or reused, and dispose of the remaining waste in a safe and environmentally-friendly manner.

                There are several methods for waste management, including landfill disposal, incineration, and recycling. Landfill disposal involves burying waste in designated areas, while incineration involves burning waste to generate energy. Recycling involves the recovery of materials from waste, such as paper, plastics, and metals, which can be used to create new products.
                
                Effective waste management practices can help reduce pollution, conserve natural resources, and minimize greenhouse gas emissions. It can also create job opportunities and generate revenue through the sale of recycled materials. However, waste management can be challenging, and requires a collaborative effort from individuals, businesses, and governments to implement effective strategies and reduce the amount of waste produced.</p>
